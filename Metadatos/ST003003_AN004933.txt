#PROJECT
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Gut microbiota and metabolites in estrus cycle and their changes in a menopausal
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	transition rat model with typical neuroendocrine aging
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Neuroendocrine alterations in the mid-life hypothalamus coupled with
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	reproductive decline herald the initiation of menopausal transition. The certain
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	feature and contribution of gut microflora and metabolites to neuroendocrine
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	changes in the menopausal transition remain largely unknown. Fecal samples of
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	rats experiencing different reproductive stages were collected and processed for
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	16S rRNA and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry sequencing. The differences
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	of gut microbiota and metabolites between young and middle-aged rats during
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	proestrus and diestrus were analyzed and their relationships to neuroendocrine
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	aging were then examined. This study documents specific gut microbial
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	composition changes and concomitant shifting trends of metabolites during
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	menopausal transition, which may initiate the gut-brain dysfunction in
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	neuroendocrine aging.

#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	Young (Y; 2-3-month-old) and middle-aged (MA; 9-10-month-old, retired breeders)
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	female rats (Sprague Dawley, Charles River, Beijing) were fed with
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	radiation-sterilized lab rodent feed (number 1010086; Jiangsu Xietong
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	Pharmaceutical Bio-engineering Co., Ltd.) and water ad libitum. A 12-hour
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	light/12-hour dark cycle (lights on at 8 a.m.) and the room temperature at 23℃
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	was held. Estrous periodicity was detected by vaginal smear for at least
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	consecutive two cycles (ten days). Only rats in possession of two regular
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	estrous periods (four to five days) were included for the subsequent assays. On
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	the basis of age and estrous stage, the rats were assigned to one of the
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	following subgroups respectively: young, proestrus and diestrus (Y-P and Y-D);
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	middle-aged, proestrus and diestrus (MA-P and MA-D). All fecal specimens were
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	harvested and quickly chilled in liquid nitrogen and finally transferred to
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	-80°C refrigerator for subsequent experiments.

#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	The fecal samples weighed 60 mg were transferred to 1.5-mL EP tubes with
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	addition of 20 μL L-2-chlorophenylalanine (0.3 mg/mL) and 20 μL Lyso PC17:0
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	(0.01 mg/ml) in methanol and 600 μL methanol/water, 4:1 (v/v). After pre-cooled
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	at -20℃ for 2 min, the samples were ground at 60 Hz for 2 min by steel beads,
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	sonicated for 10 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm, 4℃ following
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	standing still at -20℃ for 30 min. 300 μL of supernatants were dried and then
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	resolved in 400 μL methanol/water, 1:4 (v/v). The mixtures were vortexed for 30
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	s, sonicated for 2 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm, 4℃ for 10 min. 150 μL
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	supernatant was aspirated with syringes and filtered through 0.22 μm organic
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	phase pinhole filters. The extracts were transferred to LC injection vials and
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	store at -80℃ until LC-MS analysis.
